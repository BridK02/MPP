Compile the C Code:

Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory containing your C source code file (e.g., shop.c).
Use a C compiler (e.g., gcc for Unix-like systems or MinGW for Windows) to compile the code into an executable. 
The command may look like this:

gcc shop.c -o shop

Run the Executable:

After successful compilation, you should see an executable file (e.g., shop or shop.exe).
Run the executable from the terminal or command prompt:

On Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS):

./shop

On windows:

shop.exe
